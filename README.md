# üç∏ Incorruptible &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; [![GoDoc][i]][d] [![Go Report Card][b]][r]

The **Incorruptible** project provides a safer, shorter, faster
[Bearer Token](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750.html)
for session cookie and `Authorization` HTTP header.

[_Incorruptible_][d] is also a üç∏ [mocktail][m]
that the [_Gar√ßon_ de caf√©][g] likes to serve to clients.
See the [origin of the name](#üç∏-name).

## üéØ Target

- **Safer**: State-of-the-art cipher configuration,
  embedding of expiration time and client IP (optional),
  shuffled Base91 alphabet, inserted salt
  and optional random padding.

- **Shorter**: Base91-encoded (shorter than Base64),
  optimized index access (no string keys) and adaptive compression.
  The smallest token is 27 bytes long at default settings.

- **Faster**: AES-128 (no RSA),
  optimized encoding on AMD/Intel processors
  and simple/efficient serializer.

## üë∂ Motivation

At Teal.Finance, our cookies were based on [JWT][q] and [gorilla/session][s].
The JWT is standardized and we use the usual way: JSON, Base64, RSA, HMAC-SHA256‚Ä¶
This is not very fast and generates large tokens:
the long JSON string is converted into Base64 text,
to which the signature stuff is appended.

With the session cookie purpose, we are free to innovate.
We love challenges, and as a hobby we tried to replace [gorilla/session][s].
The result is _Incorruptible_. üéâ

To make the implementation successful,
we updated our security knowledge with recent state-of-the-art research.
We think we did a good job, with a good tradeoff between security, performance and low memory footprint.

## ü§´ Purpose

Currently, we use both JWT and _Incorruptible_ in production:

- JWT as an authentication provided by the [Quid][q] server (trusted third party).
- _Incorruptible_ as a session token (session cookie).

The **JWT** well suited when multiple servers manage the authentication:
it avoids sharing the private key.
We use the good old RSA, with a [32-bytes] key (256 bits).
The Auth server holds the private key.
The backend does not need to manage the user login,
because the signature provided by the authentication server is sufficient.
So our backend can be moderately secure (does not hold user data).
On the other hand, the authentication server is very well secured
(for example, we uninstall any SSH daemon on the machine).

We use _Incorruptible_ when the backend manages alone
its relationship with the frontend.
The secret is known only by the backend
(it does not need to be shared).

## üîê Encryption

The current trend toward symmetric encryption
prefers ChaCha20 / Poly1305 (server-side).
In addition to its cryptographic qualities,
ChaCha20 is easy to configure and requires
few CPU/memory resources.

On the other hand, on AMD and Intel processors,
AES is faster (optimized instructions).
In addition, the Go crypto allows to configure
AES in a simple and secure way.

Currently, we plan to use only AMD/Intel hardware (this may change).
Therefore, we currently prefer hardwired AES instructions
than ChaCha20 / Poly1305 (as chosen by Wireguard).

We place more emphasis on mastering
the encryption configuration than on performance.
See also <https://go.dev/blog/tls-cipher-suites>.

Therefore, this package currently uses only AES-GCM.
The key is 128 bits, since 256 bits are not yet relevant.
(this may change‚Ä¶)

Please share your thoughts on security or other topics.

## üç™ Encoding format

The serialization uses a format
designed for our specific needs.
The format is composed of:

- Magic code (1 byte)
- Random salt (1 byte)
- Header bits (1 byte)
- Expiration time (from 0 to 4 bytes)
- Client IP (0, 4 or 16 bytes)
- Conveyed values, up to 31 values (from 0 to 7900 bytes)
- Optional random padding (padding length is also random)

See also <https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/teal-finance/incorruptible/format>.

If the token is too long, its payload
is compressed using [Snappy S2][s2].

[s2]: https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/nziwb1/s2_fully_snappy_compatible_compression_faster_and/

The precision of the expiration time is defined
at build time with [constants in the source code][c2].
The default encoding size is 24 bits,
which gives a range of 10 years with an accuracy of 20 seconds.
The [configuration constants][c1]
allow easy decrease/increase of the storage from 1 to 4 bytes,
reducing/improving the timing precision.

A random 32-bits padding can also be appended.
This feature is currently disabled.
but can be activated with [constants in the source code][c2].

[c1]: https://github.com/teal-finance/incorruptible/blob/main/format/coding/expiry.go#L13
[c2]: https://github.com/teal-finance/incorruptible/blob/main/format/marshal.go

Then, the whole data bytes are encrypted with AES-GCM 128 bits.
This encryption adds 16 bytes including the authentication bytes.

Finally, the cipher-text is Base91 encoded, which adds a few more bytes.

In the end, the minimum required 3 bytes (Magic+Salt+Header)
becomes a 27-bytes long _Incorruptible_ token (Base91).

## üö´ Limitations

It works very well with a single server.
The secrets can be stored in a data vault,
or randomly generated at startup time.

On the other hand, in an environment with load-balancer,
or with an authentication server,
the encryption key must be shared.

Secrets sharing is a weak link in the security chain.
In this last case, JWT/CWT are preferable.
See also [Quid][q], a JWT authentication server
with signatures verified by public keys.

## üç∏ Name

The name _Incorruptible_ derives from the [incorruptible][c] drink,
a [mocktail][m] containing lemonade, grapefruit, and orange juice.

The _Incorruptible_ token has been originally implemented
as part of the [Teal.Finance/Garcon] server.
In French, "Garcon" _(gar√ßon)_ is a üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è waiter,
liking to serve drinks to clients. üòâ

We wanted a name for a drink without alcohol, using a single word,
and understandable in different languages.
So _Incorruptible_ was our best choice at that time.
